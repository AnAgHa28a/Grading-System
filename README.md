# Grading-System
Menu-driven C project using arrays. Given below are the cases considered :
Case 1: 
Get student roll number and name of 10 students 

Case 2: 
Enter ISA 1, ISA 2, and ESA marks for 6 subjects namely, UE23CS151B, UE23EE141B, UE23EV111B, UE23MA141B, UE23ME131B, UE23PH151B for each student

Case 3: 
Calculate overall marks and grades considering 40% weightage for an average of ISA 1 and ISA 2, and 60% weightage for ESA 

Case 4: 
Print grade card in tabular format student-wise showing ISA 1, ISA 2, ESA marks, final marks, and grade for each subject. 

The program uses separate C files for functions and code and then combines them using makefile.
To execute, copy all files to the same folder and execute the command (pre-requisite gcc and make should be installed)
make -f makefile.mk
This will create an executable file grade_system.exe which can be executed.
